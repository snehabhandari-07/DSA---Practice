# Basic1 - Recursion

1. Print numbers in decreasing Order
   - The approach to solve this problem is assume you have given a number 5
   - You have to print numbers from 5 to 1
   - 1st way is solve it using loop
   - But I have solved using Recursion
   - What we have to do is print 5 and call the same function for 4 / 

   - The flow of program is 
   - Print 5   - call the function for 4
   - Print 4   - call the function for 3
   - Print 3   - call the function for 2
   - Print 2   - call the function for 1
   - Print 1   - call the function for 0
   - Base case - num == 0 return 
   - Work has done
   - Work has done 
   -------- Then return the value to main / 

2. Print numbers in increasing Order
   - In this, we first call a function and then print the number
   - Let's say number is 5 /

   - Call the same function for 5
   - Call the same function for 4
   - Call the same function for 3
   - Call the same function for 2
   - Call the same function for 1
   - if num == 0 return 
   - Print 1
   - Print 2
   - Print 3
   - Print 4
   - Print 5
   - Return the value to main
